# YouTLDW

**YouTLDW** is a Chrome extension designed to save you time by automating the tedious process of extracting, copying, and summarizing YouTube video transcripts using ChatGPT. Instead of manually going through multiple steps to feed a video transcript into ChatGPT, this extension allows you to do it with just a single click—or two if you want to provide a custom prompt.

## Why This Extension?

Watching videos can be time-consuming, especially when you only need the essential information. By leveraging ChatGPT to summarize YouTube transcripts, you can quickly condense the essence of the video while preserving your time for more important tasks. However, even feeding transcripts into ChatGPT manually can be a chore:

1. Click "More..."
2. Click "Transcript"
3. Pause the video
4. Select the whole transcript
5. Copy it
6. Open a new tab and go to ChatGPT
7. Type a prompt like "summarize in bullet points:"
8. Finally, paste the copied transcript

This extension streamlines that process down to one button press—or two if you want to provide a custom prompt.

## Features

- **One-Click Summarization**: Automatically extract the transcript of a YouTube video, wrap it in a code block, and send it to ChatGPT with a predefined prompt for summarization.
- **Custom Prompts**: Use the ⚙️ button to enter your own custom prompt before sending the transcript to ChatGPT.
- **Simple and Efficient**: Save time and get straight to the point with minimal effort.

## How It Works

Once installed, the extension adds two buttons next to the "Subscribe" button on YouTube:

1. **YouTLDW Button**: Automatically extracts the transcript, wraps it in a code block, and sends it to ChatGPT with the default prompt "Summarize in bullet point:".
2. **⚙️ Settings Button**: Opens a modal where you can enter a custom prompt. The transcript is then extracted, wrapped in a code block, and sent to ChatGPT with your custom instructions.

**Note:** You must be logged into ChatGPT for this extension to work correctly.

## Installation
